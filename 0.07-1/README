Module-Starter-Plugin-CGIApp

This is a plugin for Module::Starter that builds you a skeleton 
CGI::Application module with all the extra files needed to package it for 
CPAN. You can customize the output using HTML::Template.

INSTALLATION

If you have the Module::Signature module installed, you can verify the
integrity of this distribution by typing:

    cpansign -v

Module::Signature requires GnuPG which you can get from: 
http://www.gnupg.org/download/
A binary version for Windows is available from that page.
        
Then to install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.pl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
    
On Windows you don't need to type the preliminary ./

Alternatively, you can do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are using Windows and you don't have a make utility, you can download 
nmake from:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe
(Replace make with nmake in the instructions above if you are using it.)

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules:

HTML-Template
Module-Starter

At build time you will need the above modules plus the following if you want
to run all the tests

Module-Signature
Test-Pod 1.22
Test-Pod-Coverage 1.04
Test-Perl-Critic (This test will only run if the env var TEST_AUTHOR has a 
                  true value)

They are all available on CPAN (http://www.cpan.org)
