Revision history for Module-Starter-Plugin-CGIApp


0.44    Sun Sep 20 05:09:32 EDT 2015

        *sigh* git screwup means some of the metadata might not actually match
        what's in the package.  Uploading a new version just to be sure.

0.43    Sun Sep 20 04:43:35 EDT 2015

        Internal:
        ---------

        Fixed to work with newer versions of Module-Starter. RT #101984, #66240

        Added dependency on Module::Starter >= 1.70

        In Created distributions:
        -------------------------

        t/boilerplate.t is added to MANIFEST.

        More work still needs to be done for Module-Starter parity...

0.42	Wed May 16 19:17:15 EDT 2012

        Internal:
        ---------

        The license of this module is "Same as Perl" which somewhere along
        the line I thought meant GPL 2+/Artistic 2+ when actually it is
        GPL 1+/Artistic 1+.  This is now fixed in all the relevant places.

        In Created distributions:
        -------------------------

        The same license confusion occurred here too.  Fixed.

0.41    Thu May 10 23:54:01 EDT 2012

        Internal:
        ---------

        Forgot to mention File::ShareDir as a dependency.

        While I'm at it, I normalized the format of copyright statements
        everywhere and updated the copyright year of this distro to 2012.

0.40    Thu May 10 22:58:23 EDT 2012

        Internal:
        ---------

        Breakage caused by newer versions of Module::Starter (RT#71734) has
        been fixed.

        Module has been updated to use the latest features of Module::Starter.

        Author tests have been moved into xt directory and brought up to
        current best practices.

        Templates have been moved into a share directory using File::ShareDir.

        Templates have been improved in various minor ways.

        In Created distributions:
        -------------------------

        Author tests are brought up to current best practices and now go into
        the xt directory so they don't have to be run by end users.

        Templates go into a shared directory using File::ShareDir instead
        of the old method of putting them in @INC

        Instead of pgp.mit.edu, t/00-signature.t will now use
        pool.sks-keyservers.net for key queries.

        MANIFEST.SKIP will also skip .git

        cgiapp-starter and titanium-starter had got broken during the last
        release due to an errant local and were unable to find the default
        template directory. They should work correctly now.

        t/boilerplate.t in generated dists had got broken during the last
        set of updates.  It should work correctly now.  It will now also
        check that you do not have a boilerplate abstract in your buildscript.

        Previously there was support for a generated dist with multiple
        modules but it didn't really work.  Now it does.  This justifies
        a bump in the version number I think.

        The RT address in generated modules (for bug reporting) is based on
        the distro name instead of the module name now.

0.22    Thu Mar  4 01:52:09 EST 2010
        t/00-signature.t was wrong in the module and generated dists.
        Now it will only be carried out if the envvar TEST_SIGNATURE is set.

        Unneeded dependencies deleted from the build scripts in the module
        and generated dists.

        README in the module and generated dists updated to reflect these
        changes.

0.21    Wed Mar  3 15:28:02 EST 2010
        Fixed test failures on Windows (and possibly other platforms with
        disgusting perverted non-unixy line endings.)  Thanks csjewell,
        jdb, and samuraijack on #win32@irc.perl.org and almut, ambrus, and
        banesong on Perl Monks for their help in solving these problems.
        
        Upped the recommended perl version to 5.008.

0.20    Sun Feb 28 14:02:44 EST 2010
        t/test-app.t in generated dists now passes an object to $mech->app
        to match what is done is server.pl
        
        Tests in generated dists now follow Test::XT recommendations.
        
        If the license of a generated dist is 'perl', the license blurb in
        the module and README explicitly mentions GPL+Artistic instead of
        just 'same as perl'.  A LICENSE file is added to the dist where you
        can put the license terms.

        Hopefully the problem with Build mistakenly trying to run the 
        Makefile.PLs from templates is resolved.

        Revamped test suite should be more comprehensive than before.  In
        line with Test::XT recommendations, test relevant to the author
        only, will be skipped unless envvar RELEASE_TESTING=1.  See README.

0.10    Thu Jan 15 21:12:55 EST 2009
        Added a placeholder file in t/www in generated distributions as the
        empty directory was causing error messages.
        
        More build fixes for Windows.  I think I actually have got it right
        this time.  One problem remains.  Tests will fail if the directory 
        path to where you have unpacked the module has spaces anywhere in it.
        What's up with that?
        
        Ensured that MANIFEST in generated distributions always uses / as the
        directory seperator regardless of operating system.

        Added some entries to MANIFEST.SKIP in generated distributions to
        stop the signature test from failing under Windows.
        
        Thanks to Ron Savage and Cosimo Streppone from the cgiapp list and
        ikegami, cdarke, and andreas1234567 on Perl Monks for their help in 
        solving Windows issues.

        This version just has changes to the build process which hopefully
        will make it work better under Windows.

0.07    Mon Jan  5 17:24:30 EST 2009
        No longer build depends on Test::Builder.
        
        By popular demand, templates use $self instead of $c.
        
        Distributions now include a directory, t/www for static files.
        server.pl has been updated to use it.
        
        Some fixes to tests so the module will build correctly on Windows
        thanks to David Scott <leapingfrog@yahoo.com>

        Some extra documentation for building on Windows added.

        HELP WANTED: despite my best efforts, I am not sure this module is 
        working correctly under Windows.  If you find problems, please
        submit a bug report, or even better, a fix.

0.05    Thu Sep 18 22:24:00 EDT 2008
        Added cgiapp_starter script thanks to Mark Stosberg 
        <mark@summersault.com>
        
        Building with Module::Install and ExtUtils::MakeMaker should work 
        properly now.
        
        Added some tests so we can check if the modules we are building are 
        actually complete.

        Removed cvsignore from the default templates.
        
        Generated distributions will now include a CGI::Application::Server 
        script to use as a development server.

        Generated distributions no longer require Test::Builder.
        
        Added a set of templates that use Titanium instead of CGI::Application.
        Also added titanium-starter which works like cgiapp-starter but uses 
        the Titanium templates.
        
0.01    Sun Mar 23 02:18:51 EDT 2008
        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        Creating modules that use ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Install
        is probably buggy.  Please send bug reports and patches.
