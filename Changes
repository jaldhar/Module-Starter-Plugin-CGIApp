Revision history for Module-Starter-Plugin-CGIApp

0.20    Sun Feb 28 13:17:27 EST 2010
        t/test-app.t in generated dists now passes an object to $mech->app
        to match what is done is server.pl
        
        Tests in generated dists now follow Test::XT recommendations.
        
        If the license of a generated dist is 'perl', the license blurb in
        the module and README explicitly mentions GPL+Artistic instead of
        just 'same as perl'.  A LICENSE file is added to the dist where you
        can put the license terms.

        Hopefully the problem with Build mistakenly trying to run the 
        Makefile.PLs from templates is resolved.

        Revamped test suite should be more comprehensive than before.  In
        line with Test::XT recommendations, test relevant to the author
        only, will be skipped unless envvar RELEASE_TESTING=1.  See README.

        Added a placeholder file in t/www in generated distributions as the
        empty directory was causing error messages.
        
        More build fixes for Windows.  I think I actually have got it right
        this time.  One problem remains.  Tests will fail if the directory 
        path to where you have unpacked the module has spaces anywhere in it.
        What's up with that?
        
        Ensured that MANIFEST in generated distributions always uses / as the
        directory seperator regardless of operating system.

        Added some entries to MANIFEST.SKIP in generated distributions to
        stop the signature test from failing under Windows.
        
        Thanks to Ron Savage and Cosimo Streppone from the cgiapp list and
        ikegami, cdarke, and andreas1234567 on Perl Monks for their help in 
        solving Windows issues.

        This version just has changes to the build process which hopefully
        will make it work better under Windows.

        No longer build depends on Test::Builder.
        
        By popular demand, templates use $self instead of $c.
        
        Distributions now include a directory, t/www for static files.
        server.pl has been updated to use it.
        
        Some fixes to tests so the module will build correctly on Windows
        thanks to David Scott <leapingfrog@yahoo.com>

        Some extra documentation for building on Windows added.

        HELP WANTED: despite my best efforts, I am not sure this module is 
        working correctly under Windows.  If you find problems, please
        submit a bug report, or even better, a fix.

        Added cgiapp_starter script thanks to Mark Stosberg 
        <mark@summersault.com>
        
        Building with Module::Install and ExtUtils::MakeMaker should work 
        properly now.
        
        Added some tests so we can check if the modules we are building are 
        actually complete.

        Removed cvsignore from the default templates.
        
        Generated distributions will now include a CGI::Application::Server 
        script to use as a development server.

        Generated distributions no longer require Test::Builder.
        
        Added a set of templates that use Titanium instead of CGI::Application.
        Also added titanium-starter which works like cgiapp-starter but uses 
        the Titanium templates.

        First version, released on an unsuspecting world.
        Creating modules that use ExtUtils::MakeMaker or Module::Install
        is probably buggy.  Please send bug reports and patches.
