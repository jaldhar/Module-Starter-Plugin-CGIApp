Module-Starter-Plugin-CGIApp

This is a plugin for Module::Starter that builds you a skeleton 
CGI::Application module with all the extra files needed to package it for 
CPAN. You can customize the output using HTML::Template.

INSTALLATION

If you have the Module::Signature module installed, you can verify the
integrity of this distribution by typing:

    cpansign -v

Module::Signature requires GnuPG which you can get from: 
http://www.gnupg.org/download/
A binary version for Windows is available from that page.
        
Then to install this module, run the following commands:

    perl Build.pl
    ./Build
    ./Build test
    ./Build install
    
On Windows you don't need to type the preliminary ./

Alternatively, you can do:

    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install

If you are using ActiveState perl on Windows and you don't have a make 
utility, you can download nmake from:
http://download.microsoft.com/download/vc15/patch/1.52/w95/en-us/nmake15.exe
(Replace make with nmake in the instructions above if you are using it.)

If you are using Strawberry perl on Windows, it comes with a make utility 
called dmake.  (Replace make with dmake in the instructions above if you are
using it.)

NOTE: At the moment, some of the tests will fail on Windows if the path to the 
directory you unpacked the distribution in has spaces in it.  Either skip the 
tests or move to another directory.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules:

perl 5.008
